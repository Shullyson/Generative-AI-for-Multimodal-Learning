This project focuses on integrating multimodal inputs (text and images) into generative models for advanced text and image generation tasks. The goal is to create a system that can accept both image and text inputs, process them using a generative model, and produce coherent and contextually relevant outputs.

Project Structure
multi-modal.ipynb: This Jupyter notebook contains the setup for the Large Language Model (LLM) using Flask. It also includes the code for training the model on Google Colab and using Ngrok to expose the API.

image_llama.ui: The UI file created using PyQt5 for the graphical interface.

image_llama.py: The Python script corresponding to the UI file, which handles the graphical interface and user interactions.

function.py: The main script that loads the chatbot capable of accepting both image and text inputs. It also contains the logic for processing these inputs and generating responses.

model_response.png: A screenshot of the chat output, showcasing the model's response to multimodal inputs.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/generative-ai-multimodal-learning.git
cd generative-ai-multimodal-learning
Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
Open multi-modal.ipynb in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment. Follow the instructions in the notebook to set up the Flask server and expose it using Ngrok.

Run the UI:
Execute the image_llama.py script to launch the PyQt5-based graphical interface:

bash
Copy
python image_llama.py
Interact with the Chatbot:
Use the graphical interface to input text and images. The chatbot will process these inputs and generate responses based on the integrated generative model.

Usage
Text and Image Input:

Enter text in the provided text box.

Upload an image using the image upload button.

Generate Response:

Click the "Generate" button to send the inputs to the model.

The model will process the inputs and display the generated response in the chat window.

View Model Response:

The generated response will be displayed in the chat window.
